\title{Plot Diagnostics for RVM Objects}
\usage{
\method{plot}{rvm}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An object of class \code{rvm} as returned by \code{rvm()}.}

\item{...}{Additional plotting arguments (currently ignored).}

\description{
Plots diagnostic summaries for a fitted \code{rvm} model, including predicted vs observed and residual histogram.
